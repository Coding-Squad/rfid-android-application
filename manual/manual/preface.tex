This inventory system supplements the existing inventory system used by the Russ College of Engineering and Technology to track hardware and other equipment as mandated by Ohio University. It uses a Bluetooth RFID scanner (TSL 1128 Bluetooth UHF RFID Reader) on an Android smartphone to read RFID tags on inventory items and then look up the tag in an inventory database.

\noindent\paragraph{}
The EECS Inventory Software application will provide the EECS department with a modern cloud-based inventory system. This system will involve placing RFID tags on inventoried items and using an RFID tag reader to locate the items. The Software Application will connect to the RFID Tag Reader via Bluetooth and record the time, date, serial number, and an image of the item and save this data in remote cloud storage. These features will drastically improve the current system. With the help of the RFID scanner, Application, and Cloud database, the user will be able to efficiently locate items for inventorying and then update the items location and information for the next time.
