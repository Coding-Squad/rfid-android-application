\chapter{SYSTEM ADMINISTRATIVE TASKS}

\section{Clean Up}
The database is hosted as a Firebase Realtime Database and will allow for significant inventory items to be added and modified, along with users maintained in a different storage area of Firebase. In addition, the photograph files are stored separately in Firebase storage. This cohesive storage and database system means that administrative clean up is all done through the Firebase console if need be. The admin of the application will have access to all files and database nodes, thus if there is need to delete or otherwise cleanup the data, it is possible through this console.\\

\noindent
It should be noted however, that the design of the Inventory System stipulates that items are not typically deleted, but 'Sent to Surplus' or 'Lost' or 'Stolen.'

\section{Database Management}
The management of the Firebase Realtime Database will be conducted by the sole administrator, preferably the EECS department chair, or he/she may designate another who is responsible for the department inventory.\\

\noindent
The database should require minimal management as the design of the software is to allow for efficient inventorying of the department equipment, rather than manual entries or deletion.
