\chapter{ACCOUNTS AND LOGGING IN AND OUT}

\section{ACCOUNTS}
As requested by the Chair of the EECS department, users of the application need to use their own Google accounts to access the system. The application will keep track of the current user to inform the database and future users of changes made and activity history.

\section{LOGGING IN AND OUT}
When the app opens for the first time, the users must log in using their Google accounts. It is the user's responsibility to log out by clicking on the overflow menu of the app (the three dots in the top right-hand corner) and choosing 'Sign out.'
If no user is currently signed in, the application will require a Google sign in, once again.
